# Console Minesweeper in C

You can use colors only with linux and win11

To run the code open a CMD prompt in the folder and run these lines
 
 ```bash

 ```
 
 or if you don't want to use the makefile you can compile with GCC
 
 ```bash
 gcc -o minesweeper minesweeper.c
 gcc -o minesweeper.exe minesweeper.c

Or alternatively you can launch the .exe file
